# Te1aModUtilities
Te1aModUtils (aka. Te1aModUtilities) is a client-side forge mod based on Hypixel's Lynx staff moderation tool to streamline reporting and punishing of rule breakers on Minemen Club.

## Features (Overview)
### Usable by the Community
Te1aModUtils is made to be used by both COMMUNITY MEMBERS along with staff. All players have the option to spectate and report players that are breaking the rules.

### Tools for FASTER/EASIER moderation
The point of this project is to make it easy for everyone to keep Minemen Club a safer community (with less cheaters as well!). It has tools like keybinds for actions (Follow, Ping Check, Report, Check Punishments), ability to click names
in chat to "target" a player, and more to make the process faster and easier overall.

### Open Source
Te1aModUtils is open-source, which means you can build it from scratch if you don't trust me (I can see why, I'm a random). Also, feel free to decompile the releases to double-check!

## Features (List)
### Actions
- X | Follow | Allows you to spectate a player's games using the /follow comamnd.

- V | Check | Allows *staff* members to check a target's punishment history.
  
- P | Report | Allows you to report a player.
  
- B | Ban | Lets you (*staff*) ban a target player, whether it be temporary or permanent, or with a preset or custom reason.

- M | Mute | Similar to the ban command, it lets *staff* members apply a punishment (in this case, a mute) to a target player.

- G | Jump To | Allows *staff* members to jump to a target player, regardless of their server.

- J | Toggle Reach Alerts | Toggles reach alerts on and off. They essentially display how far away the target player attacked an enemy from. **CURRENTLY EXPERIMENTAL, DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK!**

- U | Ping | Allows you to see a player's ping, useful for catching blink/backtrack cheaters.

- C | Cancel | Closes the current menu.
